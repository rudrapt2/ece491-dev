// The heap module provides dynamic memory allocation for kernel code.
//
// This is the allocator used by most of the kernel when the size or lifetime of
// an object is not known at compile time. It is analogous to malloc/calloc/
// free in user space, but it is tailoreid for kernel use and integrates with
// the kernel's page allocator when available.
//
// External users should treat this module as a service with a small API:
//   - heap_init() must be called once during boot before using kmalloc/kfree.
//   - kmalloc() allocates a requested number of bytes.
//   - kcalloc() allocates and zero-fills an array.
//   - kfree() releases a previously allocated object.
//   - copy_heap_stats() reports allocator statistics.

//
// On return kmalloc() guarantees:
// - The returned pointer points to at least /size/ bytes of memory that does
//   not overlap with any other allocated memory. (Note that this statement is
//   true even when /size/ is 0 and kmalloc() returns NULL.)
//
// Performance guarantees:
// - kmalloc() will succeed if there is a contiguous region of unallocated
//   memory of size at least /size/ plus a fixed implementation-defined overhead
//   of no more than 16 bytes.
