 * Allocates memory for the pipe struct and initializes all necessary parts for the pipe
 * You will have to modify the passed in pointers to point to the relevant pipe io interfaces. For example, you will have to create a pipe write interface that will be referenced by the wioptr. For this we also have intentionally chosen to give you freedom with how your pipes implementation works internally.
 * The following are additional details regarding implementation. You should use a simple buffer of PAGE_SIZE that you can allocate using your alloc_phys_page function We recommend head and tail pointers to keep track of read and write positions. This buffer is the channel in which we write based on the tail and read based on the head. You will also have to use condition variables to have the reader signal the writer and vice versa. This signaling has to be done on updates to the buffer so that the other can properly respond. This signaling is necessary because the reader and writer must sleep while they are waiting for the others actions. You should note that the reader should only be forced to wait if a writer exists, and a writer should only be forced to wait if a reader exists. When closing the reader or writer you should also free the buffer if it is possible (consider why it would not always be possible). This implementation facilitates one-way communication, allowing messages to be sent from one program to another, kind of like a mailbox.
